The CLI vendors the 'go-flags' repo and imports it as 'github.com/jessevdk/go-flags'. However, we maintain a custom fork of this repo because it doesn't fully support the CLI workflow. This custom fork is 'github.com/Xenophex/go-flags'. Thus we do not use gvt to manage this dependency. Instead we vendor the latest commit in 'github.com/Xenophex/go-flags' rebased with the lastest changes from upsteam ('github.com/jessevdk/go-flags').
